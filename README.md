## Project

Gratefulness has become an essential practice in my life, the aim of this project is to make it easier to practice and to also allow me to easily see all the things I am grateful for, as reflection is a slower process when using pen and paper. 

This is a chrome extension that activates everytime the user opens a new tab. The extension asks the user to input 3 things they are grateful for that day.
